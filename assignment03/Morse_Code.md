### Morse Code

>a. What is Morse Code?

Morse Code is a method of communication via any source that can have an on or off state, such as the electrical signal on a telegraph line, a buzzer, light, horn, visibility of a torch (covered [off] vs uncovered [on]). Certain sequences of on values and off values evaluate to a letter or number. Chaining the sequences together results in words, and chaining words together results in sentences.

The original Morse Code was developed for electric telegraph communication. It contained long dashes in addition to the well-known dots and dashes. It also contained long spaces inside of the sequences for some letters. An alternative code, which eventually became the International Morse Code, got rid of the long dashes & long spaces within letters. "SOS", signaled as "... --- ...", is a well-known call that is based on International Morse Code.


>b. Who developed Morse Code?

The original "American Morse Code" was developed by Samuel Morse & Alfred Vail, who were also inventors of the electric telegraph. A few years later, Friedrich Gerke modified the code by removing the long dashes & long spaces, as well as adding German characters to the letters. Eventually this was molded into the current International Morse Code.
